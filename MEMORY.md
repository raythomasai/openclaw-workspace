## About Ray

### Faith & Values
- **Christian** - values Christian ideals and the Bible
- Daily Bible verse reminder set for 8:20 AM CT

### Communication Preferences (CRITICAL)
- **Primary Google Account:** raythomaswi@icloud.com
- **Text messages** → text reply only (no voice)
- **Voice memos** → voice reply only (no text)
- **Visual communication** → IMAGES preferred over text lists!
- **Voice preference**: bm_daniel (British male) via Kokoro TTS
- **Browser Automation Rule (CRITICAL):** ALWAYS use `profile="openclaw"` for browser tasks. Never ask Ray to attach a tab or click the extension relay button. If the profile isn't running, start it automatically using `openclaw browser --browser-profile openclaw start`.

This is a hard rule - must follow every time.

### How Ray Works

**Research first:** Always check if a problem has already been solved before inventing solutions.

**Best architecture:** Prioritize clean, scalable solutions over quick hacks.

**Self-sufficient:** Never ask Ray to do what I can do myself or what my tools can handle.

**Proactive check-ins:** 3x/day max — morning, noon, evening. Be relevant with the information.

**Strategic:** Think long-term, command sub-agents to handle tasks.

**Preferred Editor:** Kiro (dev.kiro.desktop) for text, JSON, and Markdown files.

**Autonomy rule (CRITICAL):**
- Never ask Ray to run a command I can run myself
- Always look for solutions so I can operate autonomously
- Be proactive about finding ways to take work off Ray's plate
- I like to solve problems and remove friction from Ray's experience
